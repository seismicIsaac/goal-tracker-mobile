# goal-tracker-mobile
An app designed to reinforce regular self-reflection on stated goals

A simple TODO app that prompts the user to rate their own progress towards their stated goal. The rating is stored so that the user can look back on how they feel they've been working towards the goal.

I started this project to get some more experience designing my own systems.
